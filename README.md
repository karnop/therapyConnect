TherapyConnect is a two-sided marketplace designed to bridge the gap between mental health professionals and clients in the Delhi NCR region. Unlike standard directories, we act as a trusted mediator that handles scheduling, payments, and service verification.
Core Philosophy: "Frictionless Connection." We replace administrative chaos with a smooth, automated flow using video introductions ("Vibe Match"), localized logistics (Metro-based search), and a secure "OTP Handshake" to verify every session.
